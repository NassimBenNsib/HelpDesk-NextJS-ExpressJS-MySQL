## I-   Overview
### A- Features :

1.  **Account Management**:
    
    *   User registration, login, and logout.
    *   Password recovery and reset mechanisms.
    *   User profile management.
2.  **Ticket Management**:
    
    *   Create, view, update, and close support or service tickets.
    *   Prioritize and categorize tickets.
    *   Assign tickets to specific team members.
3.  **Sessions Management**:
    
    *   Implement secure session handling and storage.
    *   Allow users to view active sessions and log them out remotely.
4.  **Virtual Assistant**:
    
    *   Implement a chatbot or AI-driven virtual assistant to provide automated customer support.
5.  **Notifications**:
    
    *   Send notifications to users via email
    *   Allow users to customize their notification preferences.
6.  **Permission**:
    
    *   Define and manage user roles and permissions.
    *   Implement role-based access control (RBAC) for various parts of the application.

### B- Design and Architecture:

1.  **Advanced Folder Architecture**:
    
    *   Organize your application into modules or components for better maintainability.
2.  **Strong Architecture (MVC + Multi Layer)**:
    
    *   Follow the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture for clear separation of concerns.
    *   Implement additional layers such as service and repository layers for better code organization.
3.  **Design Pattern Like (Singleton)**:
    
    *   Use design patterns like Singleton, Factory, or Dependency Injection where appropriate.
4.  **Configurable Application**:
    
    *   Store configuration parameters in a centralized configuration file.
    *   Allow configuration to be easily updated without modifying code.
5.  **Design**:
    
    *   Implement a user-friendly and responsive design for a positive user experience.

### C- Security:

1.  **Authorization/Permission (roles & token)**:
    
    *   Implement role-based access control (RBAC) and token-based authentication.
    *   Ensure that users can only access resources they are authorized for.
2.  **Sessions/Tokens Controls**:
    
    *   Manage token expiration, refresh tokens, and implement token revocation.
    *   Provide notifications for important security-related actions (e.g., new login from a new device).
3.  **CORS: Allow/Block Domains**:
    
    *   Configure Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) to control which domains are allowed to access your API.
4.  **Rate Limiter**:
    
    *   Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse and DDoS attacks.
5.  **Validation and Sanitization**:
    
    *   Validate and sanitize user inputs to prevent common security vulnerabilities.
6.  **Fix Security Vulnerabilities**:
    
    *   Regularly update dependencies to address known vulnerabilities.
    *   Implement measures to prevent HTTP Parameter Pollution, XSS, clickjacking, and CSRF attacks.

### D- Best Practice:

1.  **Clean Code**:
    
    *   Follow clean coding practices such as meaningful variable names, proper indentation, and well-organized code structure.
2.  **Error & Exception Handling**:
    
    *   Implement comprehensive error handling with informative error messages.
    *   Use try-catch blocks to handle exceptions gracefully.
